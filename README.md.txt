The objective of the Project is to do the sentiment analysis based on the tweets data downloaded from Twitter. We'll do sentiment analysis of movie "Iron Man 3" using Hive and visualize the sentiment data using Tableau. The dataset containing tweets of "Iron Man 3" movie is located at location in HDFS.

There are various deviations possible, for example:


Use pig or spark instead of hive

Use a completely different algorithm to compute the sentiment based on NLP

Use your own Flume pipeline to download the data ~/sentiment/flume/ and start afresh with a different movie

Create your own program to download data from Twitter

Use some other mechanism of displaying the data such as D3.js or BIRT
