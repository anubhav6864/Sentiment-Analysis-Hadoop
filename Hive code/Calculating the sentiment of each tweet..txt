In this step, we will create l1, l2, and l3 views which will help us in calculating the sentiment of each tweet.

Launch hive console by typing the hive command in the web console.

hive
Create view l1. Thel1 view converts each tweet into a lower case and explodes it into a list of words. Run below command in Hive on your web console.


create view l1 as select id, words from tweets_raw lateral view explode(sentences(lower(text))) dummy as words;

Create view l2. The l2 view stores every word of a tweet in a new row. Run below command in Hive on your web console.


create view l2 as select id, word from l1 lateral view explode( words ) dummy as word ;


Create view l3. The l3 view joins l2 view with the dictionary table and stores the polarity of each word. Run below command in Hive on your web console.


create view l3 as select 
id, 
l2.word,
case d.polarity 
when  'negative' then -1
when 'positive' then 1 
else 0 end as polarity 
from l2 left outer join dictionary d on l2.word = d.word;
